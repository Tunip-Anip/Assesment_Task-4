<h1>Project Development<h1>

<h2>The Need:</h2>
To eleiviate the everlasting boredom of playing an badly done game loop with a repetitive and lacklustre <br>
story that doesn't engage with you. With creating a fun story with captivating <br>
battle mechanics to draw into the mystery behind the underlying plot.

<h2>Problem Statement:</h2> Most modern  AAA games usually have an overly repetetive game loop; progress slightly then fight hordes of monsters that have no reasons to actually being there. A game that explores the lore behind what every aspect of the sotry would lead to an expansive and immersive world which would be a turn up in modern games

<h2>Skill Development:</h2>
To develop the skills required to make the game I would need to take my current knowledge in programming and add many explanations and resources such as videos and examples to further grow in specifc programming areas and problem solving skills.

<h2>~Requirements~</h2>
<h3>Input:</h3>
The project requires the characters to move with WASD or arrow keys to allow accesability for both left and right handed players (WASD for left handed and Arrow keys for Right handed) I would make most of the inputs keyboard only as trackpad would be harder to use and not many people always carry a mouse on them.

<h3>Processing:</h3>
The game should be made as efficient as possible to guarentee a playable game expirience for most systems, but would exclude very old systems. Maybe from intel 1st gen series of cpus to modern systems. It should also have an efficient programm to calculate collisions with enemies and track enemy ai to the players posistion with coordinate differences.

<h3>Output:</h3>
Needs sprites and tiles to render and have the actions of inputs such as movement to affect the game by selecting or moving an object to where most outputs on the game are directly corolated to user inputs to enforce the interactiveness of the game.

<h3>Transmission:</h3>
With data transmission, there shouldnt be any unnecesary actions to decrease efficieny of the game but ther should be transmissions between game objects that correctly emulate the possible interactions that a game object could have.

<h3>Storage:</h3>
Needs to be stored in a safe location that wouldnt risk a mass of progress being lost at once. There should also be folders to store different objects to prevent overlapping of names and clean out errors in programming. The game should also create an easy way to save progress to continue on in later times.

<h2>Functional Requirements:</h2>

<h3>UI</h3>
Have a readable and accesable input system and have actions correlated to inputs given; W or Up Arrow makes the character go up, S/down arrow makes it go down etc. Escape should be a menu or inventory or a menu that leads into an inventory and z/x or enter/shift should be select and deselect respectively.(z and x are both far enough from the arrows to create a comfortable distance to play and not cause hand cramping.)

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
For the battle menu you have multiple options to either deal a base damadge hit heal or use a spell or another object to improve in the game. To hit buttons or levers the select key should work to minimise how many keys the player needs to remember and some puzzles could just be pushing which involves holding down the move buttons.

<h3>Progression</h3>
Have an RPG style game progression where you can backtrack to previous rooms or progress linearly this could get them closer to the end and would trigger when leaving the bounds of a room.


<h3>Saving/Loading</h3>
Include a way to save the game in designated save spots that could overwrite the previous state of the code with the new iteration to save progress, this would be in local storage to keep every save on the players on device and to make it easier to run.


<h2>Non Functional Requirements</h2>
<h3>Performance</h3>
The system could load fairly quickly but still give time for the player to process that an event has occured - When entering a new room it could fade in / out to indicate the action has occured instead of instantly changing scenes. It shouldnt have any lag for more modern computers and should mitigate lage for older systems.

<h3>UI</h3>
The button mapping for movement can be intuitive without a need for a tutorial but a slight intro for more specific actions should be added. The UI should also be easy to access and navigate with simple but descriptive labels and clear button actions.

<h3>Scalability</h3>
With getting the basis of the functions done it would be easy to expand the game as it would be making maps and elaborating on the story to fufill the final plot point.

<h3>Reliability</h3>
Should be perfectl reliable when loading and completeing actions to where there is only specific few cases where the game works out of line, it could include frequent backups that are stored safely to prevent data loss.
