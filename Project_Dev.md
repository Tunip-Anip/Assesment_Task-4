<h1>Project Development<h1>


<h2>The Need:</h2>
To alleviate the everlasting boredom of playing a badly done game loop with a repetitive and lacklustre <br>
story that doesn't engage with you. With creating a fun story with captivating <br>
battle mechanics to draw into the mystery behind the underlying plot.


<h2>Problem Statement:</h2> Most modern  AAA games usually have an overly repetitive game loop; progress slightly then fight hordes of monsters that have no reasons to actually be there. A game that explores the lore behind what every aspect of the story would lead to an expansive and immersive world which would be a turn up in modern games


<h2>Skill Development:</h2>
To develop the skills required to make the game I would need to take my current knowledge in programming and add many explanations and resources such as videos and examples to further grow in specific programming areas and problem solving skills.


<h2>~Requirements~</h2>
<h3>Input:</h3>
The project requires the characters to move with WASD or arrow keys to allow accessibility for both left and right handed players (WASD for left handed and Arrow keys for Right handed) I would make most of the inputs keyboard only as trackpad would be harder to use and not many people always carry a mouse on them.


<h3>Processing:</h3>
The game should be made as efficient as possible to guarantee a playable game experience for most systems, but would exclude very old systems. Maybe from intel 1st gen series of cpus to modern systems. It should also have an efficient program to calculate collisions with enemies and track enemy ai to the players position with coordinate differences.


<h3>Output:</h3>
Needs sprites and tiles to render and have the actions of inputs such as movement to affect the game by selecting or moving an object to where most outputs on the game are directly correlated to user inputs to enforce the interactiveness of the game.


<h3>Transmission:</h3>
With data transmission, there shouldn't be any unnecessary actions to decrease efficiency of the game but there should be transmissions between game objects that correctly emulate the possible interactions that a game object could have.


<h3>Storage:</h3>
Needs to be stored in a safe location that wouldn't risk a mass of progress being lost at once. There should also be folders to store different objects to prevent overlapping of names and clean out errors in programming. The game should also create an easy way to save progress to continue on in later times.

<h1>Success Criteria</h1>
<h2>Functional Requirements:</h2>


<h3>UI</h3>
Have a intuitive and accessible input system and have actions correlated to inputs given; W or Up Arrow makes the character go up, S/down arrow makes it go down etc. Escape should be a menu or inventory or a menu that leads into an inventory and z/x or enter/shift should be select and deselect respectively.(z and x are both far enough from the arrows to create a comfortable distance to play and not cause hand cramping.)


<h3>Gameplay</h3>
For the battle menu you have multiple options to either deal a base damage hit heal or use a spell or another object to improve in the game. To hit buttons or levers the select key should work to minimise how many keys the player needs to remember and some puzzles could just be pushing which involves holding down the move buttons.


<h3>Progression</h3>
Have an RPG style game progression where you can backtrack to previous rooms or progress linearly this could get them closer to the end and would trigger when leaving the bounds of a room.




<h3>Saving/Loading</h3>
Include a way to save the game in designated save spots that could overwrite the previous state of the code with the new iteration to save progress, this would be in local storage to keep every save on the players on device and to make it easier to run.




<h2>Non Functional Requirements</h2>
<h3>Performance</h3>
The system could load fairly quickly but still give time for the player to process that an event has occurred - When entering a new room it could fade in / out to indicate the action has occurred instead of instantly changing scenes. It shouldn't have any lag for more modern computers and should mitigate lag for older systems.


<h3>UI</h3>
The button mapping for movement can be intuitive without a need for a tutorial but a slight intro for more specific actions should be added. The UI should also be easy to access and navigate with simple but descriptive labels and clear button actions.


<h3>Scalability</h3>
With getting the basis of the functions done it would be easy to expand the game as it would be making maps and elaborating on the story to fulfill the final plot point.


<h3>Reliability</h3>
Should be perfectly reliable when loading and completing actions to where there are only specific few cases where the game works out of line, it could include frequent backups that are stored safely to prevent data loss.

<h2>Social and Ethical Complications</h2>


**Equity:**
All people have the same or similar experiences, catering to their needs.


**Accessibility:**
To have the possibilities for many people to play no matter the condition.

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
My project would be mostly usable for many groups of people. This would be completed with the implemented WASD and arrow keys controls as well as having a fully subtitled game. I could also implement precise graphics settings to accommodate for visual imparities. I will also try to  input key bind changes which may be too ambitious but will add towards helping people gain there desired button layout to increase accesebility. I will also add music changes for master volume, effects and music.

<h3>Data Protection</h3>
  

<h3>Fairness</h3>
With my game being based on a very unnatural world being the mysterious depths of the Factory depths which is a foreign world - it wouldnt contain any characters that are stereotypical with race, gender, culture or ability. This would also affect the human characters, where i could create a diverse range of characters to make everyone feel included without making ther sole purpose of adding diversity to the story.

<h3>Mental Wellbeing</h3>
I will try to make the story not too dark, horrific or violent but some themes might still be too dark for young audiences, maybe around an age of either 10+ 13+ (The age requirement of Minecraft is 10+ for comparison). This would be slightly scary themes such as mosnters and darker themes like Big Man or the design of other characters...(Scott the Roboss) I will also try to make the story have a mostly positive outcome but there will be some lower and darker bits throughout the story.

<h3>Cultural Awareness</h3>
I will not add anything hatefull or hurtfull towards any culture or religion and hopefully nothing that is made would be interpreted as something else or take a concept of the game out of hand. (An example of this is Sans from undertale being taken as devil worship which had taken the character out of his actual use in the game.) I will try to make sure the purpose of every characters is clear and has no alterior motives other than actual metaphorical meanings to themes.
